// The routed experts a decode or verification layer needs but its device cache lacks, served while
// the cached ones run. After a layer's routing a kernel splits its pairs: the cached ones run at once
// from the device tables; the missing experts are posted to pinned host memory (one "doorbell" per
// device) without any host synchronization, so the whole pass can replay as one CUDA graph. A host
// thread picks the request up immediately and, for each missing expert, either copies it into a
// device staging region by the copy engine, or has the CPU compute its pairs from the bytes in RAM
// (host experts) or from the file (disk experts). The second stage of the layer waits for the
// request on the GPU, then runs the staged experts and adds the CPU's products. The cache's own
// tables never change here; the staged experts are reached through a second table that only the
// second stage reads, so the resident stage needs no host at all.
